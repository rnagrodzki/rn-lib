        Uncomment the next line to trigger the backwards compatible
        mappings for properties, targets, and tasks most likely to
        break as a result of the naming changes introduced in Antennae
        as of 1.2.0.
        
        This mechanism should only be enabled if all projects should
        use compatibility mode, otherwise this file should be imported
        on a case by case basis. This restriction is due to the change
        in default values for build.dir, src.flex.dir, and
        src.java.dir.

        For additional details see the comments in compat-build.xml.

        This mechanism should be considered depreciated and will be
        removed in a future release of Antennae.
