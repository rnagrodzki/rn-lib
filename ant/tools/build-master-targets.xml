        This is a special targets file that should be used ahead of standard
        build-imports when you have a master build file. It redefines all of the 
        standard targets to instead loop over the child projects and call that
        target on them. In order to use this define a filelist with id
        children.filelist. For example:
        
        <filelist id="children.filelist" dir=".">
            <file name="child1"/>
            <file name="child2"/>
        </filelist>
