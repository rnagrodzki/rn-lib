	 * An AMF packet level message. Request messages and response messages have the
	 * same general structure.
	 *
	 * For requests, the targetURI specifies the location of the resource and the
	 * operation being invoked. The responseURI specifies the URI that the server
	 * must use in its response targetURI as this helps the client match it to the
	 * associated request message (and thus the correct message responder can be
	 * invoked).
	 *
	 * For responses, the server uses the targetURI to identify to the client
	 * which message this response is intended. The responseURI is ignored.
	 *
	 * When making use of by-reference serialization, the reference tables are
	 * reset for each AMFMessage. Note that targetURI and responseURI Strings are
	 * never sent by reference and do not participate in by-reference serialization.
